## 📋 Remaining Steps (2 Quick Tasks):

### 1️⃣ Add Netlify Environment Variables (hlsitech.com website)

The website chat Edge Function needs Supabase credentials to save messages.

**Quick Method - Via Netlify Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/hlsitech/env
2. Click **Add a variable**
3. Add these 4 variables:

| Key | Value | Scopes |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm.supabase.co` | All scopes |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImdncHBueXlscXBqcXV0emJkaG1tIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTQzOTUzMSwiZXhwIjoyMDc3MDE1NTMxfQ.QJgPoyhoRNI2OZ0gCzfdCeV7cvlW7s3FuH_-4bIsdd8` | All scopes |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `AIzaSyBJ0MT3q-ro7JaXcWsll3C8SF0mbwSIois` | All scopes |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_RhSExPm4_75mZUNFfD2Uw52jEwontYjH1` | All scopes |

4. Click **Save** after adding each one

**Then trigger a redeploy:**
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/hlsitech/deploys
- Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

### 2️⃣ Enable Supabase Realtime Replication

This enables live message updates in the dashboard without refreshing.

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm/database/replication
2. Find these 3 tables and toggle **Enable** for each:
   - ✅ **conversations**
   - ✅ **messages**
   - ✅ **sessions**
3. Click **Save** (if prompted)
