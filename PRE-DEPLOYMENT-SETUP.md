# Pre-Deployment Setup Guide for HLS iTech Dashboard

## Overview
This guide walks you through setting up your Supabase database and Netlify environment before testing the live chat integration.

---

## âœ… Step 1: Execute Database Schema

### Instructions:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm/sql/new
2. Open the file `DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` in this directory
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute

### What this creates:
- âœ… 10 database tables: users, agents, conversations, messages, sessions, tickets, knowledge_base, canned_responses, analytics_events, ai_interactions
- âœ… Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- âœ… Indexes for performance
- âœ… Triggers for updated_at timestamps
- âœ… Default agents (HLS iTech Support, AI Assistant)

### Expected result:
You should see "Success. No rows returned" if everything is created successfully.

---

## âœ… Step 2: Execute Storage Buckets Setup

### Instructions:
1. Stay in the SQL Editor at: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm/sql/new
2. Open the file `STORAGE_BUCKETS.sql` in this directory
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into a new SQL query
5. Click **Run** to execute

### What this creates:
- âœ… **chat-attachments** bucket (private, 10MB limit) - for chat files
- âœ… **avatars** bucket (public, 2MB limit) - for profile pictures
- âœ… **knowledge-base** bucket (public, 50MB limit) - for help articles
- âœ… **dashboard-images** bucket (public, 10MB limit) - for dashboard assets

### Verify buckets:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm/storage/buckets
2. You should see all 4 buckets listed

---

## âœ… Step 3: Enable Supabase Realtime

Real-time subscriptions allow the dashboard to receive live updates when new messages arrive.

### Instructions:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm/database/replication
2. Find the following tables and enable replication for each:
   - âœ… **conversations**
   - âœ… **messages**
   - âœ… **sessions**
3. Click **Save** after enabling each table

### Why this is needed:
Real-time replication allows the dashboard to subscribe to database changes and update the UI instantly when:
- New conversations are created
- New messages are sent
- Conversation status changes

---

## âœ… Step 4: Create Admin User

### Instructions:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm/auth/users
2. Click **Add user** â†’ **Create new user**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Email:** `info@hlsitech.com`
   - **Password:** `Wintersun6?6`
   - **âœ… Check "Auto Confirm User"** (important!)
4. Click **Create user**

### Verify:
You should see the user listed with status "Confirmed" and a green checkmark.

---

## âœ… Step 5: Configure Netlify Environment Variables (Website)

The website chat uses a Netlify Edge Function that needs Supabase credentials.

### Instructions:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/hlsitech/settings/env
2. Add the following environment variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Context |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://ggppnyylqpjqutzbdhmm.supabase.co` | All |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | (copy from `.env.local`) | All |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | (copy from `.env.local`) | All |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | (copy from `.env.local`) | All |

3. Click **Save** after adding each variable

### Get values from:
- Open `dashboard/.env.local` to find all the keys

### Verify:
After adding, you should see all 4 variables listed.

---

## âœ… Step 6: Redeploy Website (if needed)

If you added new environment variables in Step 5, redeploy the website to apply them.

### Instructions:
```bash
cd G:\hlsitechbusinesscard\hlsitech.com
git add .
git commit -m "Add Netlify environment variables"
git push origin main2
```

Alternatively, trigger a manual deploy:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/hlsitech/deploys
2. Click **Trigger deploy** â†’ **Deploy site**
